# FUN WITH PUN

Pun is a form of wordplay that exploits the different meanings of the same word (homonyms) or the fact that there are words that sound alike but have different meanings (heteronyms). From Shakespeareâ€™s plays to daily life conversations, pun has been used widely as a way to express humor. The two types of pun are expressed in the following sentences:

> I used to be a banker but I lost interest
>
> The dentist had a bad day at the orifice

In the first instance, the word 'interest' can be understood in two ways: i. the state of wanting to know or learn about sth, or ii. the money paid regularly at a particular rate. In the latter example, the word 'orifice' sounds similar to the word 'office', and therefore can be punned as heteronyms.

## Three subtasks
The tasks described below are rephrased from the tasks described in *SemEval-2017 Task 7: Detection and Interpretation of English Puns*

**Task 1:** *(Pun Detection)* Given a document of sentences that either contain a pun word or not, classify sentences with pun word (1) from those without pun word (0)

**Task 2:** *(Pun Location)* For each context that has pun word, locate the pun word (or which word is the pun word)

**Task 3:** *(Pun Interpretation)* For each context that has pun word, the system need to annotate two different senses of the pun word in WordNet

## Scorer
***Disclaimer:*** The content in this section is taken from the README.md file that can be downloaded from https://www.ukp.tu-darmstadt.de/data/sense-labelling-resources/sense-annotated-english-puns/

The `scorer/src` directory contains the Java source code for the
scoring software and the `scorer/bin` directory contains the compiled
classes.

To (re)compile the scoring software:

```
$ cd scorer
$ javac -d bin src/de/tudarmstadt/ukp/semeval2017/task7/scorer/PunScorer.java
```

To run the scoring software:

```
$ cd scorer/bin
$ java de.tudarmstadt.ukp.semeval2017.task7.scorer.PunScorer
```

Running the scorer without any command-line arguments prints the
following usage instructions:

```
Usage:
        java de.tudarmstadt.ukp.semeval2017.task7.scorer.PunScorer [ -d | -l | -i ] <goldFile> <resultFile> [ <outputFile> ]
```

The first command-line argument is required, and must be either `-d`
(for the detection subtask), `-l` (for the location subtask), or `-i`
(for the interpretation subtask).  The next two arguments are also
required; they specify the location of the gold-standard file and the
system result file, in that order.  The final optional argument
specifies the location of a file to write the output.  If the argument
is omitted, output is written to standard output.
